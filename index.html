            <p style="color: rgb(173, 133, 29);">Hi!<br><br> My name is Debora Balbino and I am the founder of Doceria by DÃ©bora Balbino.<br><br> I'm a civil engineer by formation (bachelor) and sweet candy maker by heart. I always liked to make sweets and whenever there was an event with my friends in Brazil, the dessert was made by me. It all started in my first internship, when I took brownies to my co-workers as a "welcome".<br><br> Since everyone approved, they always wanted more and that's when I started thinking about marketing my products as I saw there an opportunity to take from the paper what I loved to do, the sweet candies. Every Friday, I started making brownies to sell at my job. As the days passed by, i saw that only one day of the week wasn`t good enough. Since then, i added more sweets to my menu and started selling in most of the week.<br><br> With the number of orders increasing and the growing connection with other people than my friends, I decided to accept orders. That`s when I realized and felt the need to start a real business.<br><br>
            The orders began to increase and it was then that I started working and dedicating myself exclusively to my Sweet Grocery Store. Doceria was born from a "welcome" souvenir and today we managed to make our sweetness contagious, arriving in every home and in every space and making every customer's day happier.</p>
